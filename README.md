## Features

### Shop Tab
- **120+ local products** across 41 VIA Rail stations in Ontario, Québec, British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Saskatchewan

- **Order deadline countdown** — an 8-minute timer starts when the first item is added to cart, shown in the cart button and inside the drawer (turns red in the final 2 minutes)
- **Offline-first ordering** — orders placed in cellular dead zones are stored in a queue and synced at the next station platform

## Quick Start

### Backend (FastAPI · Port 8000)

```bash
cd backend
pip install fastapi uvicorn httpx python-dotenv
echo "OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env   # optional — degrades to demo mode without it
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### Frontend (React + Vite · Port 5173)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/offline-dashboard` | All 120+ non-perishable retail items |
| `POST` | `/api/offline-order` | Queue an order (store-and-forward) |
| `GET` | `/api/sync-queue-status` | Current queue depth and byte count |
| `POST` | `/api/simulate-sync` | Drain the queue (simulate station sync) |
| `POST` | `/api/ai/personalize` | Generate a 2-sentence personalized marketing script |
| `POST` | `/api/ai/recommend` | Return up to 3 relevant product IDs for a free-text query |
| `GET` | `/api/railopt/simulation` | Siding pass conflict calc (`?freight_delay=N`) |

---

## AI Integration

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Provider | [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) |
| Primary model | `google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite` |
| Fallback model | `meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct` |
| Env var | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in `backend/.env` |
| Degraded mode | Demo scripts / empty recommendations returned if key is absent |

The `/api/ai/recommend` endpoint receives a free-text passenger query plus optional nearest-station context and returns a ranked list of product IDs. The prompt instructs the model to return `[]` if nothing in the catalogue genuinely matches — preventing irrelevant fallback results.

---

## Product Catalogue — 41 Stations, 8 Provinces

| Province | Stations |
|----------|---------|
| Ontario | Toronto, Ottawa, Kingston, Cobourg, Belleville, Cornwall, Hamilton, Kitchener, London, Niagara Falls, Sarnia, Sudbury, Windsor |
| Québec | Montréal, Québec City, Baie-Saint-Paul, Rimouski, Jonquière, La Tuque, Senneterre |
| British Columbia | Vancouver, Prince George, Prince Rupert, Kamloops |
| Alberta | Edmonton, Jasper, Banff |
| Manitoba | Winnipeg, Thompson, The Pas, Churchill |
| New Brunswick | Moncton, Campbellton, Bathurst, Miramichi |
| Nova Scotia | Halifax, New Glasgow, Truro, Amherst |
| Saskatchewan | Saskatoon, Regina |

All items are **non-perishable and locally produced** — sourced from regional artisans, craft producers, and small vendors along the VIA Rail corridor.

## SDG Alignment

### SDG 7 — Affordable and Clean Energy
Rail optimization via siding conflict resolution reduces idle fuel burn. Each avoided idling minute produces measurable CO₂ reductions, demonstrating how AI dispatch contributes to a cleaner network.

### SDG 8 — Decent Work and Economic Growth
The platform creates a **digital marketplace channel for local artisans and small producers** who would otherwise lack access to VIA Rail's 4+ million annual passenger touchpoints — from Limestone City Craft Co. in Kingston to Indigenous art vendors in Prince Rupert.

### SDG 9 — Industry, Innovation and Resilient Infrastructure
The store-and-forward offline queue ensures orders placed during cellular dead zones (tunnels, rural stretches) are never lost — cryptographically queued and synced at the next station platform connection. Digital commerce that works as reliably as the rail itself.

### SDG 10 — Reduced Inequalities
Rural and small-station vendors (Cobourg, Churchill, Miramichi) get equal digital shelf space alongside major urban stations. Phase 1 prioritizes regional non-perishables to onboard the highest-impact, lowest-logistics-complexity vendors first.

### SDG 11 — Sustainable Cities and Communities
Enhancing the economic utility of rail travel supports modal shift away from private vehicles. Surfacing local cultural products from smaller corridor communities strengthens their identity and commerce reach to thousands of daily passengers.

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Backend framework | FastAPI 0.138+ |
| Backend server | Uvicorn (ASGI) |
| HTTP client | httpx (async) |
| Frontend framework | React 18 + Vite |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v3 |
| Icons | Lucide React |
| AI gateway | OpenRouter |
| Primary AI model | google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite |
| Fallback AI model | meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct |
| Geolocation | Browser Geolocation API + Haversine distance |
| Persistence | localStorage (profile, order history, messages) |
| Deployment | Render (single service, FastAPI serves built React frontend) |

---

## Environment Variables

```env
# backend/.env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key_here
```

---

## Deployment

The app is deployed as a single Render service. The build command compiles the React frontend and copies the output to be served as static files by FastAPI:

```yaml
buildCommand: cd frontend && npm install && npm run build && cd ../backend && pip install -r requirements.txt
startCommand: cd backend && uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in the Render environment variables dashboard to enable live AI features.
